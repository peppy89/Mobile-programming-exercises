# Employee Salary Example (Kotlin)

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming in Kotlin using an `Employee` base class and two subclasses:

- `FullTimeEmployee` – uses a fixed base salary plus a bonus.
- `PartTimeEmployee` – calculates salary from an hourly rate and hours worked.

Employees are stored in a `mapOf` and their salaries are calculated and printed in the `main()` function. This example shows inheritance, protected properties, method overriding, and simple collection usage in Kotlin.
