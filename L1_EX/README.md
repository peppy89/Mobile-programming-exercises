# Kotlin Number List Exercise

This simple Kotlin console program:

- Finds the first 50 prime numbers and stores them in a list.
- Prints that list to the console.
- Creates a list of the first 50 even numbers.
- Combines the prime and even number lists into a single list.
- Prints the combined list.

You can run the program either as a Kotlin console app (with `fun main()`) or from a Kotlin scratch file in Android Studio/IntelliJ.
